                            <p>
                                The dataset contains facial electromyography (sEMG) recordings and corresponding facial geometry data of the corresponding author (Tim Büchner) during various facial functional and emotional expressions.
                                It is designed to facilitate research in facial expression synthesis and analysis, particularly in the context of occluded facial regions and underlying muscle activity.
                                This dataset does not require any additional registration, unlike the main <strong>Mimics and Muscles</strong> dataset.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The dataset includes:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Synchronized Facial sEMG recordings</li>
                                <li>Synchronized Frontal 2D video recordings</li>
                                <li>Labels for various facial expressions (instructed and not annotated)</li>
